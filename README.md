# 📊 Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Project – Claims Process Optimization at Prosim Insurance

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt certification using a simulated case study of Prosim Insurance, a short-term insurance company. The goal was to reduce lead time, improve accuracy, and optimize the claims process using the DMAIC methodology.

> 📉 **Problem**: Claims processing at Prosim Insurance was slow, inconsistent, and error-prone — with an average lead time of 25.75 days and significant process variation.

> 🎯 **Goal**: Reduce the average lead time to ≤6 days, improve accuracy to ≥80%, and enhance customer satisfaction using data-driven process improvement.
